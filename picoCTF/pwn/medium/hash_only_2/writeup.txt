Same as version 1, but this time we can't override the binary.
Notice that it's not absolute path, so we can fiddle with PATH.
PATH is actually set to be readonly, but thanks to GPT, that readonly property is not inherited by further shell invocations.

So simply just run /bin/bash and then manipulate PATH to /home/ctf-player
Then create a shell script to run bash instead of md5sum
