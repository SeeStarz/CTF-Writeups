So the way the binary worked is it allocates a bunch of heap buffers with flags.
Lastly it allocates dummy buffer with no flag.
The order of free and malloc is purposely done so that there is no string null byte manipulation.
The usual freelist corruption by freeing manipulated fd/next pointer is also not possible due to there only being one malloc after user input.

Because tcache is on this version, and tcache is actually stored in the heap, we can actually just corrupt the tcache entry itself.
For reproducibility, i'll just assume it's reproducible enough given the same libc.
